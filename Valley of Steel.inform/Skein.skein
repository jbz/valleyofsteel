A rare moment of rest.  Your mission to steal specifications of the MitKlein Encapsulation - the ID transponder embedded in every citizen&apos;s head, even yours - was successful, and you transmitted your report to Central early this morning.   You expect a new assignment soon, even if it is only instructions to fall back into a cover identity, as you have been on the front lines of the underground struggle against Homeland Security nearly from the start.  Giving up your birth identity and life, moving instead into the flickery half-existence of an underground operative, you&apos;ve sabotaged, stolen, publicized, verified and fought for years now.  Hopefully, this last mission means that a strategy to counter the government&apos;s ubiquitous tagging of citizens is being worked out at levels above your own head.

For now, you have found yourself a small quiet park in a quiet corner of the City.

Welcome to the future.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped, folded, spindled and mutilated - and it&apos;s enough to make you scream.

Green Residential Park
Primrose Street ends here in a small circular cul-de-sac.  You&apos;re in a small green park to the north of this, bounded on its three other sides by high fences.  A few trees rise over well-manicured grass.  There is a curfew sign at the park&apos;s entrance.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can go south from here.

This kitchen is decorated in a style some four decades old, which is probably when it was last renovated.  It is fairly clean, likely reflecting the fact that the occupants don&apos;t cook for themselves much.  The built-in sink takes up most of the available counter space, with the microwave oven occupying almost all of the rest.  The refrigerator hulks along the opposite wall.

You can go north to Home Office and east from here.

Front Lobby
The slightly shabby front lobby of this multi-family building.  A door leads outside to the west, gated stairs leading up to the upper two floors are to the east, and an apartment door is to the south.

A small post-it note is stuck to the door of Apartment 1.

You can also see a newspaper and a pamphlet here.

Green Service is the local government services cluster.  The Transit station seems to reflect this, exhibiting a weary conformity - although you couldn&apos;t say exactly how.  A stairway leads down to the platform access doors, and a set of doorways lead north out onto Government Square.

A roadway approaches from the west, loops north around the square and continues to the east.  Groundcars move back and forth along the road, mixed with official vehicles such as police cars, ambulances and the ubiquitous slightly shabby black flitters used by government agencies.  The doors to Green Service Transit station are to the south.  Across the road to the east is Green Hospital&apos;s driveway.  The Hospital&apos;s main entrance is to the northeast.

Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.  Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, where a Transit capsule can be seen hovering.  The capsule doors are open.

Green Commercial Station
Green Commercial One&apos;s Transit station usually does most of its business around the rush hours, as Green Residental commuters stop off to take care of errands.  The station is relatively small, but well kept up - the Green Commercial Business Improvement District organization sees to that.  Open doorways lead south to Green Commercial One proper, and a stairway leads down to the doors to the Transit platform.

Green Commercial Plaza South
The southern end of the Green Commercial Plaza, which continues to the north.  To the east is Accessorize, a fashion store, and to the west is Garb-oh, a trendy clothing shop.  The south end of the mall is closed off by an elaborate landscaping installation of trees and shrubs, presumably to hide a relatively ugly building behind it.

This is the center of the Green Commercial Plaza.  There is a fountain here with a bench facing it.  The plaza continues to the north and south; to the east is a bar called (ironically, you hope) the Proletariat.  To the west is a Bistro Paris cafe.

Green Commercial One is built around a plaza, and this is its northern end.  No vehicles are permitted within the public areas of Green Commercial One, so the entire area is pedestrian-only.  To the north are the doorways to the Green Commercial Station.  To the east is RoughIt.  To the west is a storefront bank with an ATM.  The plaza continues to the south.

RoughIt
This diorama of a shop is the City&apos;s largest camping and outdoors supplier.  Although the store is full of equipment, it&apos;s just props, firmly secured - because everything is only available via an automated vending system, provided you don&apos;t mind your purchases being relentlessly catalogued by the Department of Homeland Security.  You stopped shopping here after they told you you couldn&apos;t buy a coffee without using biometric authentication.  One item catches your eye, though - there is a metal thermos sitting out of place atop the vending system.  Someone must have forgotten it.

On the vending system is a thermos (closed).

You can go southwest to Green Commercial Plaza Center and west to Green Commercial Plaza North from here.

This is the center of the Green Commercial Plaza.  There is a fountain here with a bench facing it.  The plaza continues to the north and south; to the east is a bar called (ironically, you hope) the Proletariat.  To the west is a Bistro Paris cafe.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can also see a trash can (in which is some rubbish) here.

You can go north to Green Commercial Plaza North, northeast to RoughIt, northwest, south to Green Commercial Plaza South, southeast, east, and west from here.

Green Commercial Station
Green Commercial One&apos;s Transit station usually does most of its business around the rush hours, as Green Residental commuters stop off to take care of errands.  The station is relatively small, but well kept up - the Green Commercial Business Improvement District organization sees to that.  Open doorways lead south to Green Commercial One proper, and a stairway leads down to the doors to the Transit platform.

Green Commercial Platform
Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.  Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, now empty.

Transit Capsule
A fifty-person maglev Transit capsule.  You&apos;re standing, holding on to a strap.  Through the windows you can see the Green Residential Platform. Several riders share the Capsule with you.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

The capsule doors slide shut.  The humming noice increases in volume, and the capsule slides out of the station, gathering speed as it goes, and slides into the tunnel..

You hold onto your strap as the Capsule rapidly accelerates.

A shabbily-dressed man wanders up to you.  He appears to be about to ask you for something, but then he catches a look at your eyes and instead wanders away again.

With a deep thrumming and the whoosh of displaced air, the Transit Capsule slides smoothly into Green Service Platform and comes to a stop, hovering in the Web.  The doors slide open and a few commuters enter and exit the capsule.

Green Service One&apos;s platform is underground.  It serves mostly city workers during the day.  There is an exit at the center of the platform which leads north through a set of closed automatic doors to a stairway leading up to the main station, just next to a large plaque with the name of the station on it.  The platform abuts the Transit web to the south, where a Transit capsule hovers impatiently in the web.  The capsule doors are open.

Green Service is the local government services cluster.  The Transit station seems to reflect this, exhibiting a weary conformity - although you couldn&apos;t say exactly how.  A stairway leads down to the platform access doors, and a set of doorways lead north out onto Government Square.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Green Commercial Platform
Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.  Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, where a Transit capsule can be seen hovering.  The capsule doors are open.

You can see a Transit Map here.

You can go south through the Green Commercial Station door (closed) to Green Commercial Station from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

A few commuters get on and off the Transit capsule.

Green Commercial Station
Green Commercial One&apos;s Transit station usually does most of its business around the rush hours, as Green Residental commuters stop off to take care of errands.  The station is relatively small, but well kept up - the Green Commercial Business Improvement District organization sees to that.  Open doorways lead south to Green Commercial One proper, and a stairway leads down to the doors to the Transit platform.

You can go south to Green Commercial Plaza North and down through the Green Commercial Station door to Green Commercial Platform from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

The automatic door slides closed.

Green Commercial Plaza North
Green Commercial One is built around a plaza, and this is its northern end.  No vehicles are permitted within the public areas of Green Commercial One, so the entire area is pedestrian-only.  To the north are the doorways to the Green Commercial Station.  To the east is RoughIt.  To the west is a storefront bank with an ATM.  The plaza continues to the south.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can also see a trash can (closed) here.

You can go north to Green Commercial Station, south to Green Commercial Plaza Center, southeast, southwest, east to RoughIt, and west from here.

The Proletariat is a local bar (not a pub).  It&apos;s just far enough above a &quot;dive&quot; to be allowed zoning here, but steadfastedly refuses to cater to upscale tastes.  You like it.  Restrooms are to the east; the bar runs along the north side with a stolid bartender behind it and a jukebox sits against the back wall.  A few hardy drinkers sit here, communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place&apos;s name, a Public Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been framed above the bar.

The Proletariat is a local bar (not a pub).  It&apos;s just far enough above a &quot;dive&quot; to be allowed zoning here, but steadfastedly refuses to cater to upscale tastes.  You like it.  Restrooms are to the east; the bar runs along the north side with a stolid bartender behind it and a jukebox sits against the back wall.  A few hardy drinkers sit here, communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place&apos;s name, a Public Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been framed above the bar.

You can see a Bartender and a man here.

You can go northwest to Green Commercial Plaza North, southwest to Green Commercial Plaza South, east to Proletariat Restroom, and west to Green Commercial Plaza Center from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

This is the center of the Green Commercial Plaza.  There is a fountain here with a bench facing it.  The plaza continues to the north and south; to the east is a bar called (ironically, you hope) the Proletariat.  To the west is a Bistro Paris cafe.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can also see a trash can (in which is some rubbish) here.

Green Commercial Bistro Paris
This is a branch of the popular lunch and coffee shop Bistro Paris.  There are a few tables near the front.  A restroom is to the west.  On the north wall, opposite the counter, is a collection of Paris-themed prints.  In the center is a large holoportrait of the chain&apos;s owner, Zuzu, and a sign claiming that the Bistro Paris has restaurants here, in the Reserve Bank Spacescraper, and in London.  A server behind the counter is waiting on several customers.

You can see a trash can (closed) here.

You can go northeast to Green Commercial Plaza North, southeast to Green Commercial Plaza South, east to Green Commercial Plaza Center, and west from here.

The Proletariat Bar
The Proletariat is a local bar (not a pub).  It&apos;s just far enough above a &quot;dive&quot; to be allowed zoning here, but steadfastedly refuses to cater to upscale tastes.  You like it.  Restrooms are to the east; the bar runs along the north side with a stolid bartender behind it and a jukebox sits against the back wall.  A few hardy drinkers sit here, communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place&apos;s name, a Public Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been framed above the bar.

You can see a Bartender and a man here.

You can go northwest to Green Commercial Plaza North, southwest to Green Commercial Plaza South, east to Proletariat Restroom, and west to Green Commercial Plaza Center from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

Proletariat Restroom
The one-holer restroom at the Proletariat is cleaner than you might think, although that may be due to the fact that it is midweek.  A scratched mirror over the sink has been covered with marker graffiti.

You can see a red jacket&apos;s antitheft tag, a white shirt&apos;s antitheft tag, a green shirt&apos;s antitheft tag, a blue jacket&apos;s antitheft tag, and a trash can (closed) here.

You can go west to The Proletariat Bar from here.

Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.  Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into the walls.

Green Service is the local government services cluster.  The Transit station seems to reflect this, exhibiting a weary conformity - although you couldn&apos;t say exactly how.  A stairway leads down to the platform access doors, and a set of doorways lead north out onto Government Square.

You can go north to Government Square South and down through the Green Service Station door to Green Service Platform from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

The automatic door slides closed.

Government Square South
This is the southern half of Government Square.  Several benches and landscape features are scattered throughout the area.  A roadway approaches from the west, loops north around the square and continues to the east.  Groundcars move back and forth along the road, mixed with official vehicles such as police cars, ambulances and the ubiquitous slightly shabby black flitters used by government agencies.  The doors to Green Service Transit station are to the south.  Across the road to the east is Green Hospital&apos;s driveway.  The Hospital&apos;s main entrance is to the northeast.  The square continues to the north.  To the northwest, across the road on the other side, is the front steps of the local police station.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can go north to Government Square North, northeast, northwest to Police Station Steps, south to Green Service Station, and east from here.

Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.  Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into the walls.

Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.  Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into the walls.

This is the southern half of Government Square.  Several benches and landscape features are scattered throughout the area.  A roadway approaches from the west, loops north around the square and continues to the east.  Groundcars move back and forth along the road, mixed with official vehicles such as police cars, ambulances and the ubiquitous slightly shabby black flitters used by government agencies.  The doors to Green Service Transit station are to the south.  Across the road to the east is Green Hospital&apos;s driveway.  The Hospital&apos;s main entrance is to the northeast.  The square continues to the north.  To the northwest, across the road on the other side, is the front steps of the local police station.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can go north to Government Square North, northeast to Hospital Entrance, northwest to Police Station Steps, south to Green Service Station, and east to Hospital Driveway from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

Green Service Station
Green Service is the local government services cluster.  The Transit station seems to reflect this, exhibiting a weary conformity - although you couldn&apos;t say exactly how.  A stairway leads down to the platform access doors, and a set of doorways lead north out onto Government Square.

You can go north to Government Square South and down through the Green Service Station door (closed) to Green Service Platform from here.

Green Service One&apos;s platform is underground.  It serves mostly city workers during the day.  There is an exit at the center of the platform which leads north through a set of closed automatic doors to a stairway leading up to the main station, just next to a large plaque with the name of the station on it.  The platform abuts the Transit web to the south, now empty.

The Lift Lobby controls underground access to the Reserve Bank spacescraper, beneath the towers of industry and capital made pillars of money and sin.  Hundreds of people rush to and fro through the lobby on their way into or out of the building.  To the north is a large bank of bouncelifts, their liftfields on and glowing faintly blue behind security gates.  Access to the bouncelifts is controlled by Lift Scanners, set above and to the right of each bouncelift entry.  There is no ceiling; several meters up, the room opens out into the street level lobby above.  There is a railing around the perimeter of the floor above; several people are leaning against or over it, watching the flow of commuters below them and around you.  The Atrium, a wide open area extending at least halfway up the spacescraper, is visible above that. There is no way to reach the street lobby from here other than via the bouncelifts. A shallow ramp leads east down to the Food Court.

You can hear the confused murmur of a large crowd coming from the Atrium above.

You can see a Powered Platform and the Security Guard here.

You can go east to Food Court and up from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

Food Court
The center of the Food Court beneath the Reserve Bank spacescraper is a busy place at all times of the day.  Around the periphery are several food stand franchises, some doing a brisk business.  Dozens of customers are here waiting in line at the food stands, sitting at the dozens of tables in the center, or just passing through from the Reserve Bank Station to the Lift Lobby up a ramp to the west or vice versa.  The floor is made of duramex tiles.

The food stands here are Reserve Bank Bistro Paris, I Have No Mouth, The Sheep Look Up, Tacos Terriff and Apollo&apos;s.

You can see a trash can (closed) here.

You can go northwest to Maintenance Area, east to Station Corridor, and west to Lift Lobby from here.

Utility Closet
The maintenance closet is dimly lit and, ironically, not terribly clean.  There are various cleaning implements and supplies stored on shelves around the walls, a fire equipment wall rack, and a large metal solvents cabinet taking up one wall.  A fluorescent light panel flickers wanly in the ceiling. Two doors lead out of the closet, one east and one west.

On the wall rack are a gas mask and a fire axe.

A scuffed disposable camera with a building property sticker on it is here.  Written on it in marker are the words &quot;DOCUMENT ALL MAINTENANCE ITEMS.&quot;

You press your doctored palm against the scanner.  The lock clicks open.

Utility Closet
The maintenance closet is dimly lit and, ironically, not terribly clean.  There are various cleaning implements and supplies stored on shelves around the walls, a fire equipment wall rack, and a large metal solvents cabinet taking up one wall.  A fluorescent light panel flickers wanly in the ceiling. Two doors lead out of the closet, one east and one west.

On the wall rack is a fire axe.

You can go east through the Maintenance Door to Maintenance Area and west from here.

The automatic door slides closed.

Atrium Ledge
This ledge, along with the others at the Mezzanine level, looks out over the huge hollow core of the Reserve Bank spacescraper&apos;s lower third.  The central column containing the main bouncelifts is visible perhaps fifty meters away.   Above, the roof of the atrium is hazily visible through the glare from its light fixtures some thirty floors up.  Thirty floors below, the main lobby can be made out.  To one side of the bouncelift column, the sublevel Lift Lobby can be seen one level below.  A very low glass wall surrounds the ledge for safety, but it&apos;s clear that this space isn&apos;t meant for the public.  There are a few holes in the plascrete floor where plants once rested; one large planter in the center holds a scarred but defiantly unbent tree.

You&apos;re pretty sure the police are looking for you now for setting off that explosive.

Main Lobby
This is the floor level of the main lobby, at the bottom of the tower atrium.

You can go up to the The Atrium (Midair) and down to Lift Lobby from here.

You reach the floor of the Main Lobby.  The confusion is immense, as thousands of people realize that their MitKlein bottles no longer function.  The various law enforcement personnel throughout the crowd are distracted and paralyzed by the fact that their equipment will no longer recognize them.  In the confusion, your landing goes nearly unnoticed.  You slip out of the descender and it whisks back upwards out of sight.

Soon, new police enter the lobby and begin organizing an evacuation while others continue their futile search for the unknown attacker.  A policeman gestures at you and a group of people near you to follow him and turns to head downstairs towards the Transit station.

Moving away, you head for the lift tube to the roof pads and your extraction point.  You cast a glance over as everyone else in the area turns to follow the policeman, and you feel the savage grin on your face.

Meek and obedient, you follow the leader down well-trodden corridors, down into the Valley of Steel. But the police can&apos;t save you.  I can.  I will.  I&apos;m coming back.  I&apos;m coming for all of you.

The Lift Lobby controls underground access to the Reserve Bank spacescraper, beneath the towers of industry and capital made pillars of money and sin.  Hundreds of people rush to and fro through the lobby on their way into or out of the building.  To the north is a large bank of bouncelifts, their liftfields on and glowing faintly blue behind security gates.  Access to the bouncelifts is controlled by Lift Scanners, set above and to the right of each bouncelift entry.  There is no ceiling; several meters up, the room opens out into the street level lobby above.  There is a railing around the perimeter of the floor above; several people are leaning against or over it, watching the flow of commuters below them and around you.  The Atrium, a wide open area extending at least halfway up the spacescraper, is visible above that. There is no way to reach the street lobby from here other than via the bouncelifts. A shallow ramp leads east down to the Food Court.

You can hear the confused murmur of a large crowd coming from the Atrium above.

Dozens of customers are here waiting in line at the food stands, sitting at the dozens of tables in the center, or just passing through from the Reserve Bank Station to the Lift Lobby up a ramp to the west or vice versa.
