Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

Welcome to the surveillance society.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped, folded, spindled and mutilated - and it&apos;s enough to make you scream.

Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

You can go north and west from here.

Entry
This is the small entryway to your apartment. A pile of mail, most of it unread, covers the small table just inside your front door.  The apartment hallway is to the south.  To the west is your office, and to the east is your bathroom.

You can see a side table (on which is a car key) here.

You can go north through the Front door (closed), south to the Hall, east and west from here.

Home Office
Your home office, a room which in other homes might be a living room, is not very tidy.  Books, random equipment and empty soda cans cover most available surfaces except for your workbench and your laptop.

You can see a workbench (on which are a multitool, a lockblade knife, a soldering iron, some solder and a laptop) here.

You can go south and east to Entry from here.

The Proletariat Bar
The Proletariat is a local bar (not a pub).  It&apos;s just far enough above a &quot;dive&quot; to be allowed zoning here, but steadfastedly refuses to cater to upscale tastes.  You like it.  Restrooms are to the east; the bar runs along the north side, a jukebox sits against the back wall, and the rest of the space is filled with bar tables.  A few hardy drinkers sit here, communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place&apos;s name, a Public Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been framed above the bar.

You can go northwest, southwest, east to the Proletariat restroom and west to Green Commercial Plaza Center from here.

Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

You can go north and west from here.

Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

You can go north and west from here.

It is a relatively smart oven, able to determine the proper setting for whatever is placed in it using a plethora of sensors.  There is a single button (marked &quot;ACTIVATE&quot;) on the front. A side panel sports a lurid warning.  The door is ajar.

The microwave oven is currently switched off.

This is the center of the Green Commercial Plaza.  There is a fountain here with a bench facing it.  The plaza continues to the north and south; to the east is a bar called (ironically, you hope) the Proletariat.  To the west is a Bistro Paris cafe.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can also see a trash can (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, south, southeast, east and west from here.
