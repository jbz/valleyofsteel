Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

The Proletariat is a local bar (not a pub).  It&apos;s just far enough above a &quot;dive&quot; to be allowed zoning here, but steadfastedly refuses to cater to upscale tastes.  You like it.  Restrooms are to the east; the bar runs along the north side, a jukebox sits against the back wall, and the rest of the space is filled with bar tables.  A few hardy drinkers sit here, communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place&apos;s name, a Public Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been framed above the bar.

You can go northwest, southwest, east and west from here.

The one-holer restroom at the Proletariat is cleaner than you might think, although that may be due to the fact that it is midweek.  A scratched mirror over the sink has been covered with marker graffiti.

Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

You can go north and west from here.

This area is used for processing prisoners…er, excuse me, suspects, and as a waiting lounge.  There is a single hard bench, now empty, and a counter along the south wall with a stern poster on the wall above it.

    <result xml:space="preserve">The Proletariat Bar
The Proletariat is a local bar (not a pub).  It&apos;s just far enough above a &quot;dive&quot; to be allowed zoning here, but steadfastedly refuses to cater to upscale tastes.  You like it.  Restrooms are to the east; the bar runs along the north side, a jukebox sits against the back wall, and the rest of the space is filled with bar tables.  A few hardy drinkers sit here, communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place&apos;s name, a Public Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been framed above the bar.

You can go northwest, southwest, east and west from here.

Green Commercial Plaza Center
This is the center of the Green Commercial Plaza.  There is a fountain here with a bench facing it.  The plaza continues to the north and south; to the east is a bar called (ironically, you hope) the Proletariat.  To the west is a Bistro Paris cafe.

You can see a trash can (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, south, southeast, east to The Proletariat Bar and west from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

You can go north and west from here.

Welcome to the surveillance society.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped, folded, spindled and mutilated - and it&apos;s enough to make you scream.

Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

You can go north and west from here.

Hall
The central hallway of your modest home.  It&apos;s relatively clean and neat, as there is no furniture in it.

You can go north, east to the Bedroom and west to the Kitchen from here.

Kitchen
Your kitchen is decorated in a style some four decades old, which is probably when it was last renovated.  It is fairly clean, reflecting the fact that you don&apos;t cook for yourself much.

You can see a refrigerator (closed), a thermos (closed) and a microwave oven here.

You can go north and east to the Hall from here.

    <result xml:space="preserve">A microwave oven of perhaps a cubic foot capacity.  It is a relatively smart oven, able to determine the proper setting for whatever is placed in it using a plethora of sensors.  There is a single button (marked &quot;ACTIVATE&quot;) on the front. A side panel sports a lurid warning.  The door is ajar.

The microwave oven is currently switched off.

Hall

Entry
This is the small entryway to your apartment. A pile of mail, most of it unread, covers the small table just inside your front door.  The apartment hallway is to the south.  To the west is your office, and to the east is your bathroom.

You can see a side table (on which is a car key) here.

You can go north through the Front door (closed), south to the Hall, east and west from here.

Home Office
Your home office, a room which in other homes might be a living room, is not very tidy.  Books, random equipment and empty soda cans cover most available surfaces except for your workbench and your laptop.

You can see a workbench (on which are a multitool, a lockblade knife, a soldering iron, some solder and a laptop) here.

You can go south and east to Entry from here.
