Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

You can go north and west from here.

This ledge, along with the others at the Mezzanine level, looks out over the huge hollow core of the Reserve Bank spacescraper&apos;s lower third.

Above, the roof of the atrium is hazily visible through the glare from its light fixtures some thirty floors up.  Sixty floors below, the main lobby can be made out.  To one side of the bouncelift column, the sublevel Lift Lobby can be seen one level below the lobby.  A very low glass wall surrounds the ledge for safety, but it&apos;s clear that this space isn&apos;t meant for the public.  A few holes in the plascrete floor hold scattered soil; one large planter in the center holds a scarred but defiantly unbent tree.

Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

You can go north and west from here.
