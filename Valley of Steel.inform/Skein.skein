Welcome to the surveillance society.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped, folded, spindled and mutilated - and it&apos;s enough to make you scream.

Valley of Steel
A tale of the surveillance society by The Custodian of http://everything2.com
Release 1 / Serial number 130310 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

You can go north and west from here.

Primrose Lane, just in front of your home.  To the south is a boarded-up empty house; sumac trees can be seen peeking over the top of the dilapidated fencing.  The fence has a plastic tarp strung behind it which prevents you from seeing much of the house.  To the west is a single-family home with a large burglar alarm warning sign and an enormous dog on the front lawn.  To the east is your building&apos;s front path.

Seating Area
The corridor ends in a small open seating area.  Through the windows the myriad internal windows of the spacescraper&apos;s other suites can be seen.  There is a door leading north, presumably to the rest of the office space.  It is closed and locked.  An observation window looks out east onto a ledge over the spacescraper&apos;s hollow core.

Atrium Ledge
This ledge, along with the others at the Mezzanine level, looks out over the huge hollow core of the Reserve Bank spacescraper&apos;s lower third.  The central column containing the main bouncelifts is visible perhaps fifty meters away.   Above, the roof of the atrium is hazily visible through the glare from its light fixtures some thirty floors up.  Sixty floors below, the main lobby can be made out.  To one side of the bouncelift column, the sublevel Lift Lobby can be seen one level below the lobby.  A very low glass wall surrounds the ledge for safety, but it&apos;s clear that this space isn&apos;t meant for the public.  A few holes in the plascrete floor hold scattered soil; one large planter in the center holds a scarred but defiantly unbent tree.

This ledge, along with the others at the Mezzanine level, looks out over the huge hollow core of the Reserve Bank spacescraper&apos;s lower third.  The central column containing the main bouncelifts is visible perhaps fifty meters away.   Above, the roof of the atrium is hazily visible through the glare from its light fixtures some thirty floors up.  Sixty floors below, the main lobby can be made out.  To one side of the bouncelift column, the sublevel Lift Lobby can be seen one level below the lobby.  A very low glass wall surrounds the ledge for safety, but it&apos;s clear that this space isn&apos;t meant for the public.  A few holes in the plascrete floor hold scattered soil; one large planter in the center holds a scarred but defiantly unbent tree.
