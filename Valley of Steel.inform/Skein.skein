A rare moment of rest.  Your mission to steal specifications of the MitKlein Encapsulation - the ID transponder embedded in every citizen&apos;s head, even yours - was successful, and you transmitted your report to Central early this morning.   You expect a new assignment soon, even if it is only instructions to fall back into a cover identity, as you have been on the front lines of the underground struggle against Homeland Security nearly from the start.  Giving up your birth identity and life, moving instead into the flickery half-existence of an underground operative, you&apos;ve sabotaged, stolen, publicized, verified and fought for years now.  Hopefully, this last mission means that a strategy to counter the government&apos;s ubiquitous tagging of citizens is being worked out at levels above your own head.

For now, you have found yourself a small quiet park in a quiet corner of the City.

Welcome to the future.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped, folded, spindled and mutilated - and it&apos;s enough to make you scream.

Green Residential Park
Primrose Street ends here in a small circular cul-de-sac.  You&apos;re in a small green park to the north of this, bounded on its three other sides by high fences.  A few trees rise over well-manicured grass.  There is a curfew sign at the park&apos;s entrance.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can go south from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

This corner of the food court is drab and uninhabited.  A closed door marked &quot;MAINTENANCE&quot; lurks to the west, and another marked &quot;RESTROOM&quot; to the north.  The floor and walls are scuffed around the door, no doubt from cleaning implements banging against them on their daily travels.

You can go north, southeast, and west through the Maintenance Door (closed) from here.

Hundreds of people rush to and fro through the lobby on their way into or out of the building.  To the north is a large bank of bouncelifts, their liftfields on and glowing faintly blue behind security gates.  Access to the bouncelifts is controlled by Lift Scanners, set above and to the right of each bouncelift entry.  There is no ceiling; several meters up, the room opens out into the street level lobby above.  There is a railing around the perimeter of the floor above; several people are leaning against or over it, watching the flow of commuters below them and around you.  The Atrium, a wide open area extending at least halfway up the spacescraper, is visible above that. There is no way to reach the street lobby from here other than via the bouncelifts. A shallow ramp leads east down to the Food Court.

You can hear the confused murmur of a large crowd coming from the Atrium above.

The Lift Lobby controls underground access to the Reserve Bank spacescraper, beneath the towers of industry and capital made pillars of money and sin.  Hundreds of people rush to and fro through the lobby on their way into or out of the building.  To the north is a large bank of bouncelifts, their liftfields on and glowing faintly blue behind security gates.  Access to the bouncelifts is controlled by Lift Scanners, set above and to the right of each bouncelift entry.  There is no ceiling; several meters up, the room opens out into the street level lobby above.  There is a railing around the perimeter of the floor above; several people are leaning against or over it, watching the flow of commuters below them and around you.  The Atrium, a wide open area extending at least halfway up the spacescraper, is visible above that. There is no way to reach the street lobby from here other than via the bouncelifts. A shallow ramp leads east down to the Food Court.

You can hear the confused murmur of a large crowd coming from the Atrium above.

You can see a Powered Platform (on which is a spool) and the Security Guard here.

You can go east to Food Court and up from here.

Food Court
The center of the Food Court beneath the Reserve Bank spacescraper is a busy place at all times of the day.  Around the periphery are several food stand franchises, some doing a brisk business.  Dozens of customers are here waiting in line at the food stands, sitting at the dozens of tables in the center, or just passing through from the Reserve Bank Station to the Lift Lobby up a ramp to the west or vice versa.  The floor is made of duramex tiles.

You can see a trash can (closed) here.

Green Commercial Plaza North
Green Commercial One is built around a plaza, and this is its northern end.  No vehicles are permitted within the public areas of Green Commercial One, so the entire area is pedestrian-only.  To the north are the doorways to the Green Commercial Station.  To the east is RoughIt.  To the west is a storefront bank with an ATM.  The plaza continues to the south.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can also see Roberto Velez and a trash can (closed) here.

You can go north, south, southeast to The Proletariat Bar, southwest, east, and west from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

Roberto Velez goes west.

Metro Savings
This is a completely nondescript bank storefront which exists solely to house an ATM.  It&apos;s so nondescript, in fact, that it took you some actual effort to determine which bank owns it, probably to ensure that they can charge you access fees no matter what.  To the east is Green Commercial Plaza.

Roberto approaches the ATM, intent on withdrawing funds to pay you for the blue jacket.
He looks at the ATM&apos;s cracked palm reader, then at you.  &quot;The ATM scanner, he is broken.&quot;  He shakes his head.

Roberto approaches the ATM, intent on withdrawing funds to pay you for the blue jacket.
Roberto places his palm on the sampler, hidden inside the ATM.  It flashes briefly.  Nothing else happens.
He shakes his head.  &quot;I am sorry, but the machine is broken.&quot;  You reassure him that you don&apos;t need paying for the jacket, at which he breaks out into a huge smile, gives you a hug, shakes your hand and quickly changes into the new blue jacket, dropping his torn jacket.  He walks out of the ATM, proudly fingering his new wardrobe.

This is a medium-sized appliance found in most modern hospitals.  It is used to provide artificial tissue for grafting into or onto injuries.  In order to prevent rejection, the tissue generator must be given a complete scan of the patient&apos;s tissue, from which it will (by default) produce an exact duplicate of the scanned sample.  It has a button marked ACTIVATE. There is a slot on the front of the machine labeled INSERT CRYOPACK FOR SAMPLE where, presumably, the generated tissue is delivered; there is a smaller opening labeled FEED and there is a slot labeled READ where a tissue sampler can be inserted.    There is a cryopack in the sample slot.  The feed slot contains biogen feedstock.

The tissue generator is currently switched off.

This diorama of a shop is the City&apos;s largest camping and outdoors supplier.  Although the store is full of equipment, it&apos;s just props, firmly secured - because everything is only available via an automated vending system, provided you don&apos;t mind your purchases being relentlessly catalogued by the Department of Homeland Security.  You stopped shopping here after they told you you couldn&apos;t buy a coffee without using biometric authentication.  One item catches your eye, though - there is a metal thermos sitting out of place atop the vending system.  Someone must have forgotten it.

On the vending system is a thermos (closed).

You can go southwest and west from here.

The maintenance closet is dimly lit and, ironically, not terribly clean.  There are various cleaning implements and supplies stored on shelves around the walls, a fire equipment wall rack, and a large metal solvents cabinet taking up one wall.  A flourescent light panel flickers wanly in the ceiling. Two doors lead out of the closet, one east and one west.

On the wall rack are a gas mask and a Fire Axe.

A scuffed disposable camera with a building property sticker on it is here.  Written on it in marker are the words &quot;DOCUMENT ALL MAINTENANCE ITEMS.&quot;

You can go east through the Maintenance Door (closed) and west from here.
