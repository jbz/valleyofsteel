Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring, indicative of how little time you spend in it while awake.  It contains your bed - currently, as always, unmade - and a bedside table with a lamp on it.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

You can go north and west from here.

Garb-oh
Garb-oh! is a trendy clothing shop.  Images of the shop&apos;s icon Greta Garbo abound, each dressed in the clothing item offered on the rack below it.  Jackets, scarves, bandannas, trousers, shirts and more are on inviting display.

On the racks are a blue jacket, a red jacket, a white shirt, a green shirt, a blue pair of pants and a brown pair of pants.

The sales counter runs along the north side of the store.

You can also see the shopkeeper and the shopper here.

You can go east through the Garb-oh door (closed) from here.

Government Square North
The north half of Government Square is surrounded on three sides by road.  Groundcars trundle back and forth, and the occasional flitter whines down to or screams up from flitter pads near the buildings across it.  The hospital driveway is to the southeast, across the road; the hospital entrance to the east and the police station to the west.  To the north is the steps to the Civil Center, the local government office building.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

It seems a tourist has left behind a cheap disposable camera, which rests on the sidewalk here.

You can go north to Civil Center Steps, south, southeast, east and west from here.

You permit the apartment door scanner to scan your eye.

Home Lobby
The slightly shabby front lobby of your building.  A door leads outside to the west, gated stairs leading up to the upper two floors are to the east, and your apartment door is to the south.

You can go south through the Front door to Entry and west through the House door (closed) from here.

The automatic door slides closed.

Booking
This area is used for processing prisoners…er, excuse me, suspects, and as a waiting lounge.  There is a single hard bench, now empty, and a counter along the south wall with a stern poster on the wall above it.  One area has been kept clear and is a neutral pale blue, presumably to be used as a backdrop for photographing suspects.

You can see an ID camera here.

You can go north to the Front Desk from here.

A very low glass wall surrounds the ledge for safety, but it&apos;s clear that this space isn&apos;t meant for the public.

Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

Welcome to the surveillance society.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped, folded, spindled and mutilated - and it&apos;s enough to make you scream.

Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

You can go north and west from here.

It has a button marked ACTIVATE. There is a slot on the front of the machine labeled &quot;INSERT CRYOPACK FOR SAMPLE&quot; where, presumably, the generated tissue is delivered; there is a smaller opening labeled &quot;FEED&quot; and there is a slot labeled &quot;READ&quot; where a tissue sampler can be inserted.

Reserve Bank Station
The Reserve Bank Transit Station. The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the west.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors, with each person turning their head to the right as they approach for the eye scanner to verify their identity before opening the portal long enough for them to slip through.  The floor and walls are both clean duramex nanotile, and the station name (Reserve Bank) is indicated on large plaques set into the walls.  At either end of the platform, closed gates guard against any entry into the slideway tunnels. A platform abuts a Transit web, now empty.

You can go west through the Reserve Bank Station door (closed) from here.

Tacos Terriff is a bare-bones Mexicalitexazonan food joint.  Meat product is scooped into grain-plastic shells and covered with various unidentifiable industrial sauces and shredded veggies.  Despite this, it seems to have a dedicated following, as it is doing land-office business with the lunch set.
