A rare moment of rest.  Your mission to steal specifications of the MitKlein Encapsulation - the ID transponder embedded in every citizen&apos;s head, even yours - was successful, and you transmitted your report to Central early this morning.   You expect a new assignment soon, even if it is only instructions to fall back into a cover identity, as you have been on the front lines of the underground struggle against Homeland Security nearly from the start.  Giving up your birth identity and life, moving instead into the flickery half-existence of an underground operative, you&apos;ve sabotaged, stolen, publicized, verified and fought for years now.  Hopefully, this last mission means that a strategy to counter the government&apos;s ubiquitous tagging of citizens is being worked out at levels above your own head.

For now, you have found yourself a small quiet park in a quiet corner of the City.

Welcome to the future.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped, folded, spindled and mutilated - and it&apos;s enough to make you scream.

Green Residential Park
Primrose Street ends here in a small circular cul-de-sac.  You&apos;re in a small green park to the north of this, bounded on its three other sides by high fences.  A few trees rise over well-manicured grass.  There is a curfew sign at the park&apos;s entrance.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can go south from here.

South Primrose Lane
Primrose Lane continues to the north.  To the south is a boarded-up empty house; sumac plants can be seen peeking over the top of the dilapidated fencing.  The fence has a plastic tarp strung behind it which prevents you from seeing much of the house.  To the west is a single-family home with a large warning sign and an enormous dog on the front lawn.  To the east is a three-family residence&apos;s front path.

The capsule doors slide shut.  The humming noice increases in volume, and the capsule slides out of the station, gathering speed as it goes, and slides into the tunnel.

Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.  Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, where a Transit capsule can be seen hovering.  The capsule doors are open.

You can see a Transit Map here.

You can go south through the Green Commercial Station door (closed) from here.

Green Commercial Station
Green Commercial One&apos;s Transit station usually does most of its business around the rush hours, as Green Residental commuters stop off to take care of errands.  The station is relatively small, but well kept up - the Green Commercial Business Improvement District organization sees to that.  Open doorways lead south to Green Commercial One proper, and a stairway leads down to the doors to the Transit platform.

Green Commercial One&apos;s Transit station usually does most of its business around the rush hours, as Green Residental commuters stop off to take care of errands.

Open doorways lead south to Green Commercial One proper, and a stairway leads down to the doors to the Transit platform.

Green Commercial Platform
Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.  Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, now empty.

Standing just south of the fence, you see an abandoned house on the south side of the lot. The front yard is a mess of trash and litter.  A few people are hanging around the closed front door.  They are looking at you with unfriendly stares.

South Primrose Lane
Primrose Lane continues to the north.  To the south is a boarded-up empty house; sumac plants can be seen peeking over the top of the dilapidated fencing.  The fence has a plastic tarp strung behind it which prevents you from seeing much of the house.  To the west is a single-family home with a large warning sign and an enormous dog on the front lawn.  To the east is a three-family residence&apos;s front path.

Government Square North
The north half of Government Square is surrounded on three sides by roadway.  Groundcars trundle back and forth, and the occasional flitter whines down to or screams up from flitter pads near the buildings across it.  The hospital driveway is to the southeast, across the road; the hospital entrance to the east and the police station to the west.  To the north is the steps to the Civil Center, the local government office building.

Government Square South
This is the southern half of Government Square.  Several benches and landscape features are scattered throughout the area.  A roadway approaches from the west, loops north around the square and continues to the east.  Groundcars move back and forth along the road, mixed with official vehicles such as police cars, ambulances and the ubiquitous slightly shabby black flitters used by government agencies.  The doors to Green Service Transit station are to the south.  Across the road to the east is Green Hospital&apos;s driveway.  The Hospital&apos;s main entrance is to the northeast.  The square continues to the north.  To the northwest, across the road on the other side, is the front steps of the local police station.

Green Commercial Station
Green Commercial One&apos;s Transit station usually does most of its business around the rush hours, as Green Residental commuters stop off to take care of errands.  The station is relatively small, but well kept up - the Green Commercial Business Improvement District organization sees to that.  Open doorways lead south to Green Commercial One proper, and a stairway leads down to the doors to the Transit platform.

You can go south to Green Commercial Plaza North and down through the Green Commercial Station door to Green Commercial Platform from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

The automatic door slides closed.

Green Commercial Plaza Center
This is the center of the Green Commercial Plaza.  There is a fountain here with a bench facing it.  The plaza continues to the north and south; to the east is a bar called (ironically, you hope) the Proletariat.  To the west is a Bistro Paris cafe.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can also see a trash can (closed) here.

You can go north to Green Commercial Plaza North, northeast, northwest to Metro Savings, south to Green Commercial Plaza South, southeast, east to The Proletariat Bar, and west to Green Commercial Bistro Paris from here.

Open doorways lead south to Green Commercial One proper, and a stairway leads down to the doors to the Transit platform.

Green Commercial Platform
Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.  Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, now empty.

South Primrose Lane
Primrose Lane continues to the north.  To the south is a boarded-up empty house; sumac plants can be seen peeking over the top of the dilapidated fencing.  The fence has a plastic tarp strung behind it which prevents you from seeing much of the house.  To the west is a single-family home with a large warning sign and an enormous dog on the front lawn.  To the east is a three-family residence&apos;s front path.

You arrive at South Primrose Lane to a scene of chaos.  Police vehicles are pulled up all over the road, cyclone lights flashing.  As you watch, heavily armed SWAT officers file through the hole in the fence towards the Drug Market.   A staticky transmission over the radio of the vehicles near you says quietly &quot;Breaching charges in place.&quot;  You can hear a voice on a bullhorn shout &quot;You have thirty seconds to surrender!&quot;

A few seconds later, there is a deep thundering BOOM as the breaching charges detonate, and a confused hubbub as (presumably) the SWAT officers rush into the abandoned house.

    <commentary xml:space="preserve">Green Service Platform
Green Service One&apos;s platform is underground.  It serves mostly city workers during the day.  There is an exit at the center of the platform which leads north through a set of closed automatic doors to a stairway leading up to the main station, just next to a large plaque with the name of the station on it.  The platform abuts the Transit web to the south, where a Transit capsule hovers impatiently in the web.  The capsule doors are open.

You can see a Transit Map here.

Government Square South
This is the southern half of Government Square.  Several benches and landscape features are scattered throughout the area.  A roadway approaches from the west, loops north around the square and continues to the east.  Groundcars move back and forth along the road, mixed with official vehicles such as police cars, ambulances and the ubiquitous slightly shabby black flitters used by government agencies.  The doors to Green Service Transit station are to the south.  Across the road to the east is Green Hospital&apos;s driveway.  The Hospital&apos;s main entrance is to the northeast.  The square continues to the north.  To the northwest, across the road on the other side, is the front steps of the local police station.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can go north to Government Square North, northeast to Hospital Entrance, northwest to Police Station Steps, south to Green Service Station, and east to Hospital Driveway from here.

The Eye Scanner scans the iris printed on the contact lens to determine your identity.  The Reserve Bank Security Subroutine determines that &quot;you&quot; have a legitimate reason to enter the Reserve Bank spacescraper, and the doors slide smoothly open.

Station Corridor
The corridor widens as it terminates at the automatic doors to the Reserve Bank Station, which lies to the east.  We Morlocks trundle to and fro without speaking to each other, in fear of camera and of mike and of might Eloi paycheck-cutting wrath.  Although traffic is overwhelmingly to the west, there are two doors reserved for traffic into the station, indicated by green lightbars overhead, whose access scanners are active.

You can go east through the Reserve Bank Station door to Reserve Bank Station and west from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

The automatic door slides closed.

Food Court
The center of the Food Court beneath the Reserve Bank spacescraper is a busy place at all times of the day.  Around the periphery are several food stand franchises, some doing a brisk business.  Hundreds of people are here waiting in line at the food stands, sitting at the dozens of tables in the center, or just passing through from the Reserve Bank Station to the Lift Lobby up a ramp to the west or vice versa.  The floor is made of duramex tiles, nondescript gray matte shedding scuff marks with the determination of the designed servant into nanogrout channels in between.  During the short nighttime lull, the floor will seem to creep slightly as the nanogrout slowly flows the daytime grime along the channels to dispose of it into the walls.

You can see a trash can (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, south, southeast, southwest, east to Station Corridor, and west from here.

Lift Lobby
The Lift Lobby controls underground access to the Reserve Bank spacescraper, beneath the towers of industry and capital made pillars of money and sin.  Hundreds of people rush to and fro through the lobby on their way into or out of the building.  To the north is a large bank of bouncelifts, their liftfields on and glowing faintly blue behind security gates.  Access to the bouncelifts is controlled by Lift Scanners, set above and to the right of each bouncelift entry.  There is no ceiling; several meters up, the room opens out into the street level lobby above.  There is a railing around the perimeter of the floor above; several people are leaning against or over it, watching the flow of commuters below them and around you.  The Atrium, a wide open area extending at least halfway up the spacescraper, is visible above that. There is no way to reach the street lobby from here other than via the bouncelifts. A shallow ramp leads east down to the Food Court.

You can hear the confused murmur of a large crowd coming from the Atrium above.

You can see a Powered Platform (on which is a spool) and the Security Guard here.

You can go east to Food Court and up from here.

Utility Closet
The maintenance closet is dimly lit and, ironically, not terribly clean.  There are various cleaning implements and supplies stored on shelves around the walls, a fire equipment wall rack, and a large metal solvents cabinet taking up one wall.  A flourescent light panel flickers wanly in the ceiling. Two doors lead out of the closet, one east and one west.

On the wall rack are a gas mask and a Fire Axe.

Maintenance Area
This corner of the food court is drab and uninhabited.  A closed door marked &quot;MAINTENANCE&quot; lurks to the west, and another marked &quot;RESTROOM&quot; to the north.  The floor and walls are scuffed around the door, no doubt from cleaning implements banging against them on their daily travels.

You can go north, south, southeast to Food Court, east, and west through the Maintenance Door to the Utility Closet from here.

The automatic door slides closed.

Food Court
The center of the Food Court beneath the Reserve Bank spacescraper is a busy place at all times of the day.  Around the periphery are several food stand franchises, some doing a brisk business.  Hundreds of people are here waiting in line at the food stands, sitting at the dozens of tables in the center, or just passing through from the Reserve Bank Station to the Lift Lobby up a ramp to the west or vice versa.  The floor is made of duramex tiles, nondescript gray matte shedding scuff marks with the determination of the designed servant into nanogrout channels in between.  During the short nighttime lull, the floor will seem to creep slightly as the nanogrout slowly flows the daytime grime along the channels to dispose of it into the walls.

You can see a trash can (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest to Maintenance Area, south, southeast, southwest, east to Station Corridor, and west to Lift Lobby from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

The maintenance closet is dimly lit and, ironically, not terribly clean.  There are various cleaning implements and supplies stored on shelves around the walls, a fire equipment wall rack, and a large metal solvents cabinet taking up one wall.  A flourescent light panel flickers wanly in the ceiling. Two doors lead out of the closet, one east and one west.

On the wall rack is a Fire Axe.
