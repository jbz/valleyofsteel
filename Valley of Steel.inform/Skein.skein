A rare moment of rest.  Your mission to steal specifications of the MitKlein Encapsulation - the ID transponder embedded in every citizen&apos;s head, even yours - was successful, and you transmitted your report to Central early this morning.   You expect a new assignment soon, even if it is only instructions to fall back into a cover identity, as you have been on the front lines of the underground struggle against Homeland Security nearly from the start.  Giving up your birth identity and life, moving instead into the flickery half-existence of an underground operative, you&apos;ve sabotaged, stolen, publicized, verified and fought for years now.  Hopefully, this last mission means that a strategy to counter the government&apos;s ubiquitous tagging of citizens is being worked out at levels above your own head.

For now, you have found yourself a small quiet park in a quiet corner of the City.

Welcome to the future.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped, folded, spindled and mutilated - and it&apos;s enough to make you scream.

Green Residential Park
Primrose Street ends here in a small circular cul-de-sac.  To the north of this is a small green park, bounded on its three other sides by high fences.  A few trees rise over well-manicured grass.  There is a curfew sign at the park&apos;s entrance.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can go south from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

Garb-oh
Garb-oh! is a trendy clothing shop.  Images of the shop&apos;s icon Greta Garbo abound, each dressed in the clothing item offered on the rack below it.  Jackets, scarves, bandannas, trousers, shirts and more are on inviting display.

On the racks are a blue jacket, a red jacket, a white shirt, a green shirt, a blue pair of pants, and a brown pair of pants.

The sales counter runs along the north side of the store.

You can also see the shopkeeper and the shopper here.

You can go east through the Garb-oh door (closed) from here.

The shopper puts down a last item of clothing and drifts towards the door.  As she reaches it, however, the antitheft alarm blares and a strobe light begins to flash!  She stops, frozen in surprise, as the shopkeeper rushes over and grabs her.  A few seconds later, two policemen enter the shop.  The shopkeeper, shopper and police all begin shouting at the same time.

[Scene &apos;Shoplifting&apos; ends]
The police finally search the shopper&apos;s shoulder bag, and shake their heads.  They lead her towards the door, one explaining that they&apos;ll need to take her statement at the station.  The shopkeeper asks snippily what they&apos;ll be doing to protect her stock; Officer Prescott rolls his eyes and says &quot;Lady, we&apos;ll have our patrol stop in the plaza out front for a while in case this one has any accomplices, all right?&quot;  They leave, and the shopkeeper watches them go with a somewhat irritatingly smug expression on her face.

Green Commercial Plaza South
The southern end of the Green Commercial Plaza, which continues to the north.  To the east is Accessorize, a fashion store, and to the west is Garb-oh, a trendy clothing shop.  The south end of the mall is closed off by an elaborate landscaping installation of trees and shrubs, presumably to hide a relatively ugly building behind it.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can also see a trash can (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, east, and west through the Garb-oh door to Garb-oh from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

A police officer ambles out of Green Commercial Bistro Paris.  As he approaches the flitter, the flitter key transponder on his belt disables the locklarm.  He climbs in and shuts the door.  A few moments later, the aircraft powers up. The turbines spool up and, its beacons flashing, it lifts smoothly into the air, disappearing behind the building tops.

A police officer ambles out of Green Commercial Bistro Paris.  As he approaches the flitter, the flitter key transponder on his belt disables the locklarm.  He climbs in and shuts the door.  A few moments later, the aircraft powers up. The turbines spool up and, its beacons flashing, it lifts smoothly into the air, disappearing behind the building tops.

South Primrose Lane
Primrose Lane continues to the north.  To the south is a boarded-up empty house; sumac plants can be seen peeking over the top of the dilapidated fencing.  The fence has a plastic tarp strung behind it which prevents you from seeing much of the house.  To the west is a single-family home with a large warning sign and an enormous dog on the front lawn.  To the east is a three-family residence&apos;s front path.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can go north to Primrose &amp; Cedar and east to Front Path from here.

Green Service Station
Green Service is the local government services cluster.  The Transit station seems to reflect this, exhibiting a weary conformity - although you couldn&apos;t say exactly how.  A stairway leads down to the platform access doors, and a set of doors lead north out onto Government Square.

You can go north to Government Square South and down through the Green Service Station door (closed) to Green Service Platform from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

Green Service Platform
Green Service One&apos;s platform is underground.  It serves mostly city workers during the day.  There is an exit at the center of the platform which leads north through a set of closed automatic doors to a stairway leading up to the main station, just next to a large plaque with the name of the station on it.  The platform abuts the Transit web to the south, now empty.

The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into the walls.

The Proletariat is a local bar (not a pub).  It&apos;s just far enough above a &quot;dive&quot; to be allowed zoning here, but steadfastedly refuses to cater to upscale tastes.  You like it.  Restrooms are to the east; the bar runs along the north side with a stolid bartender behind it and a jukebox sits against the back wall.  A few hardy drinkers sit here, communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place&apos;s name, a Public Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been framed above the bar.

Green Commercial Platform
Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.  Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, now empty.

You can go south through the Green Commercial Station door to Green Commercial Station from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

The automatic door slides closed.

The Door Scanner scans your iris to determine your identity.  The Transit Security and Accounting Subroutine determines that you have a legitimate account with the Transit system, and the doors slide smoothly open.

Green Residential Platform
Green Residential&apos;s platform serves mostly residential commuters.  There is an exit at the center of the platform which leads east through a set of closed automatic doors to a stairway leading up to the main station, just next to a large plaque with the name of the station on it.  The platform abuts the Transit web to the west, now empty.

You can go east through the Green Residential Station door to Green Residential Station from here.

This is the front desk of the police station. A harried sergeant is manning the desk, and are so busy they don&apos;t even have time to give you more than a brief scowl.  To the north is a security gate leading into the police station proper, and to the south is an open area with a sign reading &quot;BOOKING.&quot;

You can see Sergeant Ramirez here.

Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.  Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, where a Transit capsule can be seen hovering.  The capsule doors are open.

You can go south through the Green Commercial Station door (closed) to Green Commercial Station from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

A few commuters get on and off the Transit capsule.

Green Commercial Station
Green Commercial One&apos;s Transit station usually does most of its business around the rush hours, as Green Residental commuters stop off to take care of errands.  The station is relatively small, but well kept up - the Green Commercial Business Improvement District organization sees to that.  Doors lead south to Green Commercial One proper, and a stairway leads down to the doors to the Transit platform.

You can go south to Green Commercial Plaza North and down through the Green Commercial Station door to Green Commercial Platform from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

The automatic door slides closed.

In the center is a large holoportrait of the chain&apos;s owner, Zuzu, and a sign claiming that the Bistro Paris has restaurants here, in the Reserve Bank Spacescraper, and in London.  A server behind the counter is waiting on several customers.

You can see a trash can (closed) here.

You can go northeast to Green Commercial Plaza North, southeast to Green Commercial Plaza South, east to Green Commercial Plaza Center, and west from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

Green Commercial Plaza Center
This is the center of the Green Commercial Plaza.  There is a fountain here with a bench facing it.  The plaza continues to the north and south; to the east is a bar called (ironically, you hope) the Proletariat.  To the west is a Bistro Paris cafe.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can also see a trash can (closed) here.

You can go north to Green Commercial Plaza North, northeast, northwest to Metro Savings, south to Green Commercial Plaza South, southeast, east to The Proletariat Bar, and west to Green Commercial Bistro Paris from here.

This is obviously a home office, a room which in other homes might be a living room. It is not very tidy.  Random detritus covers most available surfaces except for a workbench.

South Primrose Lane
Primrose Lane continues to the north.  To the south is a boarded-up empty house; sumac plants can be seen peeking over the top of the dilapidated fencing.  The fence has a plastic tarp strung behind it which prevents you from seeing much of the house.  To the west is a single-family home with a large warning sign and an enormous dog on the front lawn.  To the east is a three-family residence&apos;s front path.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can go north, south to Drug Market, and east to Front Path from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

You arrive at South Primrose Lane to a scene of chaos.  Police vehicles are pulled up all over the road, cyclone lights flashing.  As you watch, heavily armed SWAT officers file through the hole in the fence towards the Drug Market.   A staticky transmission over the radio of the vehicles near you says quietly &quot;Breaching charges in place.&quot;  You can hear a voice on a bullhorn shout &quot;You have thirty seconds to surrender!&quot;

A few seconds later, there is a deep thundering BOOM as the breaching charges detonate, and a confused hubbub as (presumably) the SWAT officers rush into the abandoned house.
