A rare moment of rest.  Your mission to steal specifications of the MitKlein Encapsulation - the ID transponder embedded in every citizen&apos;s head, even yours - was successful, and you transmitted your report to Central early this morning.   You expect a new assignment soon, even if it is only instructions to fall back into a cover identity, as you have been on the front lines of the underground struggle against Homeland Security nearly from the start.  Giving up your birth identity and life, moving instead into the flickery half-existence of an underground operative, you&apos;ve sabotaged, stolen, publicized, verified and fought for years now.  Hopefully, this last mission means that a strategy to counter the government&apos;s ubiquitous tagging of citizens is being worked out at levels above your own head.

For now, you have found yourself a small quiet park in a quiet corner of the City.

Welcome to the future.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped, folded, spindled and mutilated - and it&apos;s enough to make you scream.

Green Residential Park
Primrose Street ends here in a small circular cul-de-sac.  To the north of this is a small green park, bounded on its three other sides by high fences.  A few trees rise over well-manicured grass.  There is a curfew sign at the park&apos;s entrance.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can go south from here.

South Primrose Lane
Primrose Lane continues to the north.  To the south is a boarded-up empty house; sumac plants can be seen peeking over the top of the dilapidated fencing.  The fence has a plastic tarp strung behind it which prevents you from seeing much of the house.  To the west is a single-family home with a large warning sign and an enormous dog on the front lawn.  To the east is a three-family residence&apos;s front path.

Green Residential Station
This is a utilitarian (read: boring) facility intended mostly to keep the rain out of the Transit System.  A stairway leads down to the Transit platform and an exit leads east to the street.

You can go east to Primrose &amp; Cedar and down through the Green Residential Station door (closed) from here.

Green Residential Platform
Green Residential&apos;s platform serves mostly residential commuters.  There is an exit at the center of the platform which leads east through a set of closed automatic doors to a stairway leading up to the main station, just next to a large plaque with the name of the station on it.  The platform abuts the Transit web to the west, now empty.

Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.  Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, where a Transit capsule can be seen hovering.  The capsule doors are open.

The Proletariat is a local bar (not a pub).  It&apos;s just far enough above a &quot;dive&quot; to be allowed zoning here, but steadfastedly refuses to cater to upscale tastes.  You like it.  Restrooms are to the east; the bar runs along the north side with a stolid bartender behind it and a jukebox sits against the back wall.  A few hardy drinkers sit here, communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place&apos;s name, a Public Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been framed above the bar.

You can see Roberto Velez here.

A police officer ambles out of Green Commercial Bistro Paris.  As he approaches the flitter, the flitter key transponder on his belt disables the locklarm.  He climbs in and shuts the door.  A few moments later, the aircraft powers up. The turbines spool up and, its beacons flashing, it lifts smoothly into the air, disappearing behind the building tops.

Doors lead south to Green Commercial One proper, and a stairway leads down to the doors to the Transit platform.

Green Commercial Platform
Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.  Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, now empty.

Green Service is the local government services cluster.  The Transit station seems to reflect this, exhibiting a weary conformity - although you couldn&apos;t say exactly how.  A stairway leads down to the platform access doors, and a set of doors lead north out onto Government Square.

This is the southern half of Government Square.  Several benches and landscape features are scattered throughout the area.  A roadway approaches from the west, loops north around the square and continues to the east.  Groundcars move back and forth along the road, mixed with official vehicles such as police cars, ambulances and the ubiquitous slightly shabby black flitters used by government agencies.  The doors to Green Service Transit station are to the south.  Across the road to the east is Green Hospital&apos;s driveway.  The Hospital&apos;s main entrance is to the northeast.  The square continues to the north.  To the northwest, across the road on the other side, is the front steps of the local police station.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

Police Station Steps
These are the busy steps of the local police station.  To the east and southeast is Government Square, while the police station lies at the top to the west. Uniformed police and people in plain clothes are traversing the steps to exit and enter the building.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

Government Square North
The north half of Government Square is surrounded on three sides by road.  Groundcars trundle back and forth, and the occasional flitter whines down to or screams up from flitter pads near the buildings across it.  The hospital driveway is to the southeast, across the road; the hospital entrance to the east and the police station to the west.  To the north is the steps to the Civil Center, the local government office building.

Government Square South
This is the southern half of Government Square.  Several benches and landscape features are scattered throughout the area.  A roadway approaches from the west, loops north around the square and continues to the east.  Groundcars move back and forth along the road, mixed with official vehicles such as police cars, ambulances and the ubiquitous slightly shabby black flitters used by government agencies.  The doors to Green Service Transit station are to the south.  Across the road to the east is Green Hospital&apos;s driveway.  The Hospital&apos;s main entrance is to the northeast.  The square continues to the north.  To the northwest, across the road on the other side, is the front steps of the local police station.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

Green Commercial Station
Green Commercial One&apos;s Transit station usually does most of its business around the rush hours, as Green Residental commuters stop off to take care of errands.  The station is relatively small, but well kept up - the Green Commercial Business Improvement District organization sees to that.  Doors lead south to Green Commercial One proper, and a stairway leads down to the doors to the Transit platform.

You can go south to Green Commercial Plaza North and down through the Green Commercial Station door to Green Commercial Platform from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

The automatic door slides closed.

Green Commercial Plaza Center
This is the center of the Green Commercial Plaza.  There is a fountain here with a bench facing it.  The plaza continues to the north and south; to the east is a bar called (ironically, you hope) the Proletariat.  To the west is a Bistro Paris cafe.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can also see a trash can (closed) here.

You can go north to Green Commercial Plaza North, northeast, northwest to Metro Savings, south to Green Commercial Plaza South, southeast, east to The Proletariat Bar, and west to Green Commercial Bistro Paris from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

Green Commercial Plaza South
The southern end of the Green Commercial Plaza, which continues to the north.  To the east is Accessorize, a fashion store, and to the west is Garb-oh, a trendy clothing shop.  The south end of the mall is closed off by an elaborate landscaping installation of trees and shrubs, presumably to hide a relatively ugly building behind it.
