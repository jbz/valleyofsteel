Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

The Proletariat is a local bar (not a pub).  It&apos;s just far enough above a &quot;dive&quot; to be allowed zoning here, but steadfastedly refuses to cater to upscale tastes.  You like it.  Restrooms are to the east; the bar runs along the north side, a jukebox sits against the back wall, and the rest of the space is filled with bar tables.  A few hardy drinkers sit here, communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place&apos;s name, a Public Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been framed above the bar.

You can go northwest, southwest, east and west from here.

Proletariat restroom
The one-holer restroom at the Proletariat is cleaner than you might think, although that may be due to the fact that it is midweek.  A scratched mirror over the sink has been covered with marker graffiti.

You can see a trash can (closed) here.

You can go west to The Proletariat Bar from here.

Welcome to the surveillance society.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped, folded, spindled and mutilated - and it&apos;s enough to make you scream.

Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

You can go north and west from here.

The Proletariat is a local bar (not a pub).  It&apos;s just far enough above a &quot;dive&quot; to be allowed zoning here, but steadfastedly refuses to cater to upscale tastes.  You like it.  Restrooms are to the east; the bar runs along the north side, a jukebox sits against the back wall, and the rest of the space is filled with bar tables.  A few hardy drinkers sit here, communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place&apos;s name, a Public Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been framed above the bar.

You can go northwest, southwest, east and west from here.

Green Commercial Plaza Center
This is the center of the Green Commercial Plaza.  There is a fountain here with a bench facing it.  The plaza continues to the north and south; to the east is a bar called (ironically, you hope) the Proletariat.  To the west is a Bistro Paris cafe.

You can see a trash can (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, south, southeast, east to The Proletariat Bar and west from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

The Proletariat Bar
The Proletariat is a local bar (not a pub).  It&apos;s just far enough above a &quot;dive&quot; to be allowed zoning here, but steadfastedly refuses to cater to upscale tastes.  You like it.  Restrooms are to the east; the bar runs along the north side, a jukebox sits against the back wall, and the rest of the space is filled with bar tables.  A few hardy drinkers sit here, communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place&apos;s name, a Public Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been framed above the bar.

You can go northwest, southwest, east to the Proletariat restroom and west to Green Commercial Plaza Center from here.

Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

You can go north and west from here.

Welcome to the surveillance society.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped, folded, spindled and mutilated - and it&apos;s enough to make you scream.

Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

You can go north and west from here.
