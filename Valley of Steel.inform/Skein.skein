Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

The Proletariat is a local bar (not a pub).  It&apos;s just far enough above a &quot;dive&quot; to be allowed zoning here, but steadfastedly refuses to cater to upscale tastes.  You like it.  Restrooms are to the east; the bar runs along the north side, a jukebox sits against the back wall, and the rest of the space is filled with bar tables.  A few hardy drinkers sit here, communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place&apos;s name, a Public Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been framed above the bar.

You can go northwest, southwest, east and west from here.

The one-holer restroom at the Proletariat is cleaner than you might think, although that may be due to the fact that it is midweek.  A scratched mirror over the sink has been covered with marker graffiti.

    <command xml:space="preserve">read pamphlet</command>
    <result xml:space="preserve">The pamphlet has your name and address printed on one face, and is from the Department of Homeland Security.  It seems that they believe you are due to have a child any day now (which would surprise you if this was not the fifth time they had decided you were due such a blessed event). 

As such, the pamphlet is meant to inform you of your duty as a citizen to ensure your child has his or her Mitsui-Klein encapsulation properly implanted by their birth hospital.  Along with two or three not-so-veiled hints as to the penalties for avoiding implantation, the pamplet also contains a very familiar boilerplate description of the MitKlein Bottle which you and all your fellow citizens carry within your skulls.  Inserted at birth, the MitKlein becomes embedded in the bone structure of the skull as the fontanelles close and harden.  It contains just enough electronics to act as a transponder which will identify its owner, securely, to any nearby chip scanner over a range of perhaps five meters or less.

Given your recent hacking activities, it is likely that any such scanning of your MitKlein will turn you instantly into a fugitive - unless the Department of Homeland Security has more pressing things to worry about.

The Proletariat is a local bar (not a pub).  It&apos;s just far enough above a &quot;dive&quot; to be allowed zoning here, but steadfastedly refuses to cater to upscale tastes.  You like it.  Restrooms are to the east; the bar runs along the north side, a jukebox sits against the back wall, and the rest of the space is filled with bar tables.  A few hardy drinkers sit here, communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place&apos;s name, a Public Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been framed above the bar.

You can go northwest, southwest, east and west from here.

Green Commercial Plaza Center
This is the center of the Green Commercial Plaza.  There is a fountain here with a bench facing it.  The plaza continues to the north and south; to the east is a bar called (ironically, you hope) the Proletariat.  To the west is a Bistro Paris cafe.

You can see a trash can (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, south, southeast, east to The Proletariat Bar and west from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

Green Commercial Plaza Center
This is the center of the Green Commercial Plaza.  There is a fountain here with a bench facing it.  The plaza continues to the north and south; to the east is a bar called (ironically, you hope) the Proletariat.  To the west is a Bistro Paris cafe.

You can see a trash can (closed) here.

You can go north, northeast, northwest, south, southeast, east to The Proletariat Bar and west from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

The Proletariat Bar
The Proletariat is a local bar (not a pub).  It&apos;s just far enough above a &quot;dive&quot; to be allowed zoning here, but steadfastedly refuses to cater to upscale tastes.  You like it.  Restrooms are to the east; the bar runs along the north side, a jukebox sits against the back wall, and the rest of the space is filled with bar tables.  A few hardy drinkers sit here, communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place&apos;s name, a Public Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been framed above the bar.

You can go northwest, southwest, east to the Proletariat restroom and west to Green Commercial Plaza Center from here.

Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

You can go north and west from here.

Welcome to the surveillance society.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped, folded, spindled and mutilated - and it&apos;s enough to make you scream.

Bedroom
Your bedroom is rather boring.  It contains your bed - currently unmade - and the usual assortment of bedroom furnishings including a bedside table, next to the bed.

On the bedside table are a watch and a phone.

You can go north and west from here.

Kitchen
Your kitchen is decorated in a style some four decades old, which is probably when it was last renovated.  It is fairly clean, reflecting the fact that you don&apos;t cook for yourself much.

You can see a refrigerator (closed), a thermos (closed) and a microwave oven here.

You can go north and east to the Hall from here.

    <result xml:space="preserve">A microwave oven of perhaps a cubic foot capacity.  It is a relatively smart oven, able to determine the proper setting for whatever is placed in it using a plethora of sensors.  There is a single button (marked &quot;ACTIVATE&quot;) on the front. A side panel sports a lurid warning.  The door is ajar.

The microwave oven is currently switched off.

Hall
The central hallway of your modest home.  It&apos;s relatively clean and neat, as there is no furniture in it.

You can go north, east to the Bedroom and west to the Kitchen from here.
