A rare moment of rest.  Your mission to steal specifications of the MitKlein Encapsulation - the ID transponder embedded in every citizen&apos;s head, even yours - was successful, and you transmitted your report to Central early this morning.   You expect a new assignment soon, even if it is only instructions to fall back into a cover identity, as you have been on the front lines of the underground struggle against Homeland Security nearly from the start.  Giving up your birth identity and life, moving instead into the flickery half-existence of an underground operative, you&apos;ve sabotaged, stolen, publicized, verified and fought for years now.  Hopefully, this last mission means that a strategy to counter the government&apos;s ubiquitous tagging of citizens is being worked out at levels above your own head.

For now, you have found yourself a small quiet park in a quiet corner of the City.

Welcome to the future.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped, folded, spindled and mutilated - and it&apos;s enough to make you scream.

Green Residential Park
Primrose Street ends here in a small circular cul-de-sac.  You&apos;re in a small green park to the north of this, bounded on its three other sides by high fences.  A few trees rise over well-manicured grass.  There is a curfew sign at the park&apos;s entrance.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can go south from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

The Reserve Bank Transit Station. The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the west.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors, with each person turning their head to the right as they approach for the eye scanner to verify their identity before opening the portal long enough for them to slip through.  The floor and walls are both clean duramex nanotile, and the station name (Reserve Bank) is indicated on large plaques set into the walls.  At either end of the platform, closed gates guard against any entry into the slideway tunnels. A platform abuts a Transit web, where a Transit capsule can be seen hovering.

Hundreds of people rush to and fro through the lobby on their way into or out of the building.  To the north is a large bank of bouncelifts, their liftfields on and glowing faintly blue behind security gates.  Access to the bouncelifts is controlled by Lift Scanners, set above and to the right of each bouncelift entry.  There is no ceiling; several meters up, the room opens out into the street level lobby above.  There is a railing around the perimeter of the floor above; several people are leaning against or over it, watching the flow of commuters below them and around you.  The Atrium, a wide open area extending at least halfway up the spacescraper, is visible above that. There is no way to reach the street lobby from here other than via the bouncelifts. A shallow ramp leads east down to the Food Court.

You can hear the confused murmur of a large crowd coming from the Atrium above.

You can see a side table (on which is a car key) here.

You can go north through the Apartment door (closed) to Front Lobby, south to Hall, east, and west from here.

Home Office
This is obviously a home office, a room which in other homes might be a living room. It is not very tidy.  Random detritus covers most available surfaces except for a workbench.

You can see a workbench (on which are a lockblade knife, a soldering iron, some solder, and a laptop) here.

This kitchen is decorated in a style some four decades old, which is probably when it was last renovated.  It is fairly clean, likely reflecting the fact that the occupants don&apos;t cook for themselves much.  The built-in sink takes up most of the available counter, with the microwave oven occupying almost all of the rest.  The refrigerator hulks along the opposite wall.

The Door Scanner scans your iris to determine your identity.  The Transit Security and Accounting Subroutine determines that you have a legitimate account with the Transit system, and the doors slide smoothly open.

Green Residential Platform
Green Residential&apos;s platform serves mostly residential commuters.  There is an exit at the center of the platform which leads east through a set of closed automatic doors to a stairway leading up to the main station, just next to a large plaque with the name of the station on it.  The platform abuts the Transit web to the west, where a Transit capsule hovers impatiently.  The capsule doors are open.

Hospital Lobby
This is the main entrance to a busy regional hospital. Autodoors lie to the west.  Patients and staff rush back and forth, all too busy to pay you any attention.  To the south is an archway with a sign reading &quot;TRIAGE&quot;; to the east is the elevator core and to the north is the waiting lounge.

You can go north, south, east, and west through the Hospital door to Hospital Entrance from here.

Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.  Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, where a Transit capsule can be seen hovering.  The capsule doors are open.

You can see a Transit Map here.

You can go south through the Green Commercial Station door (closed) from here.

Green Commercial Station
Green Commercial One&apos;s Transit station usually does most of its business around the rush hours, as Green Residental commuters stop off to take care of errands.  The station is relatively small, but well kept up - the Green Commercial Business Improvement District organization sees to that.  Open doorways lead south to Green Commercial One proper, and a stairway leads down to the doors to the Transit platform.

Restrooms are to the east; the bar runs along the north side with a stolid bartender behind it and a jukebox sits against the back wall.  A few hardy drinkers sit here, communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place&apos;s name, a Public Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been framed above the bar.

You can see a Bartender and Roberto Velez here.

You can go northwest to Green Commercial Plaza North, southwest to Green Commercial Plaza South, east to Proletariat Restroom, and west to Green Commercial Plaza Center from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

Green Commercial Plaza Center
This is the center of the Green Commercial Plaza.  There is a fountain here with a bench facing it.  The plaza continues to the north and south; to the east is a bar called (ironically, you hope) the Proletariat.  To the west is a Bistro Paris cafe.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can also see a trash can (closed) here.

Green Commercial Plaza South
The southern end of the Green Commercial Plaza, which continues to the north.  To the east is Accessorize, a fashion store, and to the west is Garb-oh, a trendy clothing shop.  The south end of the mall is closed off by an elaborate landscaping installation of trees and shrubs, presumably to hide a relatively ugly building behind it.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

A parked police flitter, armored and festooned with lights, looms here.

A police officer ambles out of Green Commercial Bistro Paris.  As he approaches the flitter, the flitter key transponder on his belt disables the locklarm.
He then climbs into the flitter and shuts the door.  A few moments later, the aircraft powers up. The turbines spool up and, its beacons flashing, it lifts smoothly into the air, disappearing behind the building tops.

Open doorways lead south to Green Commercial One proper, and a stairway leads down to the doors to the Transit platform.

Green Commercial Platform
Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.  Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, now empty.

A few commuters get on and off the Transit capsule.

The capsule doors slide shut.  The humming noice increases in volume, and the capsule slides out of the station, gathering speed as it goes, and slides into the tunnel.
You hold onto your strap as the Capsule rapidly accelerates.

With a deep thrumming and the whoosh of displaced air, the Transit Capsule slides smoothly into Green Commercial Platform and comes to a stop, hovering in the Web.  The doors slide open and a few commuters enter and exit the capsule.

Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.  Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, where a Transit capsule can be seen hovering.  The capsule doors are open.

You can see a Transit Map here.

You can go south through the Green Commercial Station door (closed) to Green Commercial Station from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

Green Commercial Station
Green Commercial One&apos;s Transit station usually does most of its business around the rush hours, as Green Residental commuters stop off to take care of errands.  The station is relatively small, but well kept up - the Green Commercial Business Improvement District organization sees to that.  Open doorways lead south to Green Commercial One proper, and a stairway leads down to the doors to the Transit platform.

You can go south to Green Commercial Plaza North and down through the Green Commercial Station door to Green Commercial Platform from here.

The automatic door slides closed.

To the north are the doorways to the Green Commercial Station.  To the east is the NanoMart.  To the west is a storefront bank with an ATM.  The plaza continues to the south.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can also see a trash can (closed) here.

You can go north to Green Commercial Station, south to Green Commercial Plaza Center, southeast to The Proletariat Bar, southwest, east, and west to Metro Savings from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

Green Commercial Bistro Paris
This is a branch of the popular lunch and coffee shop Bistro Paris.  There are a few tables near the front.  A restroom is to the west.  On the north wall, opposite the counter, is a collection of Paris-themed prints.  In the center is a large holoportrait of the chain&apos;s owner, Zuzu, and a sign claiming that the Bistro Paris has restaurants here, in the Reserve Bank Spacescraper, and in London.  A server behind the counter is waiting on several customers.

You can see Officer Prescott and a trash can (closed) here.

Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.  Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, now empty.

You arrive at South Primrose Lane to a scene of chaos.  Police vehicles are pulled up all over the road, cyclone lights flashing.  As you watch, heavily armed SWAT officers file through the hole in the fence towards the Drug Market.   A staticky transmission over the radio of the vehicles near you says quietly &quot;Breaching charges in place.&quot;  You can hear a voice on a bullhorn shout &quot;You have thirty seconds to surrender!&quot;

A few seconds later, there is a deep thundering BOOM as the breaching charges detonate, and a confused hubbub as (presumably) the SWAT officers rush into the abandoned house.

With a deep thrumming and the whoosh of displaced air, the Transit Capsule slides smoothly into Reserve Bank Station and comes to a stop, hovering in the Web.  The doors slide open and a few commuters enter and exit the capsule.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Reserve Bank Station
The Reserve Bank Transit Station. The platform opens out at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the west.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors, with each person turning their head to the right as they approach for the eye scanner to verify their identity before opening the portal long enough for them to slip through.  The floor and walls are both clean duramex nanotile, and the station name (Reserve Bank) is indicated on large plaques set into the walls.  At either end of the platform, closed gates guard against any entry into the slideway tunnels. A platform abuts a Transit web, where a Transit capsule can be seen hovering.  The capsule doors are open.

You can see a Transit Map here.

You can go west through the Reserve Bank Station door (closed) from here.

Food Court
The center of the Food Court beneath the Reserve Bank spacescraper is a busy place at all times of the day.  Around the periphery are several food stand franchises, some doing a brisk business.  Hundreds of people are here waiting in line at the food stands, sitting at the dozens of tables in the center, or just passing through from the Reserve Bank Station to the Lift Lobby up a ramp to the west or vice versa.  The floor is made of duramex tiles, nondescript gray matte shedding scuff marks with the determination of the designed servant into nanogrout channels in between.  During the short nighttime lull, the floor will seem to creep slightly as the nanogrout slowly flows the daytime grime along the channels to dispose of it into the walls.

Lift Lobby
The Lift Lobby controls underground access to the Reserve Bank spacescraper, beneath the towers of industry and capital made pillars of money and sin.  Hundreds of people rush to and fro through the lobby on their way into or out of the building.  To the north is a large bank of bouncelifts, their liftfields on and glowing faintly blue behind security gates.  Access to the bouncelifts is controlled by Lift Scanners, set above and to the right of each bouncelift entry.  There is no ceiling; several meters up, the room opens out into the street level lobby above.  There is a railing around the perimeter of the floor above; several people are leaning against or over it, watching the flow of commuters below them and around you.  The Atrium, a wide open area extending at least halfway up the spacescraper, is visible above that. There is no way to reach the street lobby from here other than via the bouncelifts. A shallow ramp leads east down to the Food Court.

You can hear the confused murmur of a large crowd coming from the Atrium above.

You can see a Powered Platform (on which is a spool) and the Security Guard here.

The floor is made of duramex tiles, nondescript gray matte shedding scuff marks with the determination of the designed servant into nanogrout channels in between.

The maintenance closet is dimly lit and, ironically, not terribly clean.  There are various cleaning implements and supplies stored on shelves around the walls, a fire equipment wall rack, and a large metal solvents cabinet taking up one wall.  A flourescent light panel flickers wanly in the ceiling. Two doors lead out of the closet, one east and one west.

On the wall rack is a Fire Axe.

Main Lobby
This is the floor level of the main lobby, at the bottom of the tower atrium.

You can go up to the The Atrium (Midair) and down to Lift Lobby from here.

You reach the floor of the Main Lobby.  The confusion is immense, as thousands of people realize that their MitKlein bottles no longer function.  The various law enforcement personnel throughout the crowd are distracted and paralyzed by the fact that their equipment will no longer recognize them.  In the confusion, your landing goes nearly unnoticed.  You slip out of the descender and it whisks back upwards out of sight.

Soon, new police enter the lobby and begin organizing an evacuation while others continue their futile search for the unknown attacker.  A policeman gestures at you and a group of people near you to follow him and turns to head downstairs towards the Transit station.

Moving away, you head for the lift tube to the roof pads and your extraction point.  You cast a glance over as everyone else in the area turns to follow the policeman, and you feel the savage grin on your face.

Meek and obedient, you follow the leader down well-trodden corridors, down into the Valley of Steel. But the police can&apos;t save you.  I can.  I will.  I&apos;m coming back.  I&apos;m coming for all of you.

Green Commercial Plaza North
Green Commercial One is built around a plaza, and this is its northern end.  No vehicles are permitted within the public areas of Green Commercial One, so the entire area is pedestrian-only.  To the north are the doorways to the Green Commercial Station.  To the east is RoughIt.  To the west is a storefront bank with an ATM.  The plaza continues to the south.

The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over the low skyline.

You can also see a man and a trash can (closed) here.

You can go north, south, southeast to The Proletariat Bar, southwest, east, and west from here.

There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

a man goes west.

This is a completely nondescript bank storefront which exists solely to house an ATM.  It&apos;s so nondescript, in fact, that it took you some actual effort to determine which bank owns it, probably to ensure that they can charge you access fees no matter what.  To the east is Green Commercial Plaza.

Roberto approaches the ATM, intent on withdrawing funds to pay you for the blue jacket.
He looks at the ATM&apos;s cracked palm reader, then at you.  &quot;The ATM scanner, he is broken.&quot;  He shakes his head.

The Proletariat is a local bar (not a pub).  It&apos;s just far enough above a &quot;dive&quot; to be allowed zoning here, but steadfastedly refuses to cater to upscale tastes.  You like it.  Restrooms are to the east; the bar runs along the north side with a stolid bartender behind it and a jukebox sits against the back wall.  A few hardy drinkers sit here, communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place&apos;s name, a Public Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been framed above the bar.
