Valley of Steel game design notes

===>  CURRENT PROBLEMS


GENERAL:

FIXED biogen feedstock is OUT OF PLAY.

During Drug Raid, things at the cordon should be visible (policeman who shoves you, eg).

FIXED. Put a 'REPORT DRUGS' poster in police station as hint?

Roberto should explain where he's going when he leaves to go to ATM lol

Put a backdrop of reserve bank spacescraper into skyline, direction proper from commercial/service/residential?

Lens Crafter is broken. Asks for Memory in slot (wrong), can't use menu, and 'just works when turned on' if camera is present.  Fix this.  Also, put lens case somewhere other than in machine? Or change 'action' message?

Need verb 'solder' for combining.  Maybe understand as 'attach'?

Maybe 'cutting' should just work if you have the knife, rather than asking what you want to cut it with?  But would that mess up tag removal etc?  SEE EXAMPLE 'PADDINGTON'!

FIXED FOR NOW - WHERE DO YOU GET DISPOSABLE CAMERAS? 

FIXED 'photographing' needs to work for disposable cameras as well as ID camera!

FIXED. Trash Can:  Vandalizing *one* trash can solar panel makes them *ALL* describe as being vandalised.  Also, the 'vandalised' description says the panel is empty even if it's not.

Clock thinks that the failure to pick up an object after trying to put things in the backpack to make room fails when it's closed should be more explicit that you haven't taken the object.

FIXED Trying to 'attach' (probably to 'combine', too) something which isn't in the component table borks because it doesn't have an item-id property, and putting a check for that in the 'check combining' rule doesn't seem to stop this

Undo is enabled globally.  Change this?  (extensions to manage it or use global 'use undo prevention')

FIXED EVERYTHING takes a minute.  Some things maybe shouldn't?  Getting inventory, looking at the watch, at least.

FIXED (via global error msg)  - 'Use' verb is totally borked for everything. :-(

FIXED KleinBlaster problem - the Memory chip doesn't need to be programmed to make a KleinBlaster. :-(  Maybe have programming the chip'swap it' for a different chip type? (no, just have programming write the correct item-id)


Puzzle idea - have to mod nametag on torn jacket to get onto platform?


GREEN RESIDENTIAL:

FIXED.  -No way of knowing possible directions to travel.  (Use Exit Lister by Gavin Lambert extension? (TRIED) Or rewrite descriptions? Some things, like security gate outside apartment, will be 'left out of' Exit Lister when maybe you don't want that to happen)


MAYBE FIXED: [MICROWAVE] Microwave is confusing - can't use control, have to know the magic command 'microwave'.  Can't activate it either since it's a device.  Is it worth changing this whole thing to a device with a timed activation?  The panel is hard, too - looking at 'warning sticker' looks at the sticker on the cryopack, not the panel.  Trying to 'press button' turns on the soldering iron via button, not the microwave.  REENGINEER.  Add'l - maybe have to unplug oven to hack it? Possible, not necessary.  ALSO:  'open panel with tool' doesn't work, but 'open panel' does if holding the tool. Ugh.  'open panel with knife' gives 'can't unlock' message.  Also:  'component slot' doesn't work, just 'panel' does, but it's described as 'component slot.'  

[LAPTOP] Clock says interacting with laptop is 'clunky', maybe polish descriptions?  Maybe change commands?

FIXED? Car key.  You can't 'open' it with or without the knife.  'Open' tries to unlock.  Ugh.  You can only 'cut' it.  Maybe change description to describe it as a rubberized, sealed unit? Discouraging 'open' and etc?

FIXED - Security gate outside apt - make it an object(door)?, so player can try to unlock and open it, etc?

- Coffee - going into thermos as object, not liquid.  Should be in a cup, pourable into thermos, and it should short out any chip in the thermos. OR: should be eliminated?

FIXED - Drug den - need more clues that it's a place player should go.  Maybe hear/see activity from behind the fence?  Also:  "REPORT THINGS" posters around game as a hint?

FIXED - Fence should be a scenery/backdrop object, not a description ghost.

FIXED - You can't examine the dog in front of the other house because it doesn't exist. :-P

- MORE INFO ABOUT MITSUI-KLEIN BOTTLES NEEDED IN HOME

FIXED - FRY MEMORY AND BROADCAST USED IN HACKING OVEN? DONE.


TRANSIT:

FIXED -'enter capsule' doesn't work!  Doh.

CUTTING ACTIVITY

-uncuttable things that aren't containers (phone, pager, etc)
-uncuttable things that ARE containers (oven box, thermos, slots, etc)
-cuttable things that ARE containers to open them (tags, key)
-cuttable things that ARE containers to NOT open them (tags)
-cuttable things that AREN'T containers (fence, camera chain)



Possible code:

Understand "cut [something] with [something] as sutting it with.

Instead of cutting something:
	if a blade (called the edge) is held by the player:
		try cutting the noun with the edge;
	otherwise say "You don't seem to have anything to cut with."

Cutting it with is an action applying to two things.

Check cutting it with:
	if the noun is a person, say "That would be a wonderful way to get arrested." instead;
	if the second noun is not a blade, say "[The second noun] doesn't have a blade." instead.

Carry out cutting it with:
	<<do something>>

Carry out cutting a container with something:
	now the noun is open;
	now the noun is unopenable.

Carry out cutting something which is a part of something with something:
	say "You free [the noun] with a quick cut.";
	move the noun to the player.


Report cutting it with:
	if the noun is open and the noun contains something,
		say "Visible within [is-are a list of things in the noun]."

After printing the name of a closed unopenable container:
	omit contents in listing.
