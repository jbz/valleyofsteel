Valley of Steel game design notes


===>  CURRENT PROBLEMS


GENERAL:

'open side panel with knife -> you can't open the side panel with that.'

FIXED biogen feedstock is OUT OF PLAY.

FIXED During Drug Raid, things at the cordon should be visible (policeman who shoves you, eg).

FIXED. Put a 'REPORT DRUGS' poster in police station as hint?

Roberto should explain where he's going when he leaves to go to ATM lol

Put a backdrop of reserve bank spacescraper into skyline, direction proper from commercial/service/residential?

Lens Crafter is broken. Asks for Memory in slot (wrong), can't use menu, and 'just works when turned on' if camera is present.  Fix this.  Also, put lens case somewhere other than in machine? Or change 'action' message?

WONTFIX Need verb 'solder' for combining.  Maybe understand as 'attach'?

FIXED Maybe 'cutting' should just work if you have the knife, rather than asking what you want to cut it with?  But would that mess up tag removal etc?  SEE EXAMPLE 'PADDINGTON'!

FIXED FOR NOW - WHERE DO YOU GET DISPOSABLE CAMERAS? 

FIXED 'photographing' needs to work for disposable cameras as well as ID camera!

FIXED. Trash Can:  Vandalizing *one* trash can solar panel makes them *ALL* describe as being vandalised.  Also, the 'vandalised' description says the panel is empty even if it's not.

WONTFIX Clock thinks that the failure to pick up an object after trying to put things in the backpack to make room fails when it's closed should be more explicit that you haven't taken the object.

FIXED Trying to 'attach' (probably to 'combine', too) something which isn't in the component table borks because it doesn't have an item-id property, and putting a check for that in the 'check combining' rule doesn't seem to stop this

Undo is enabled globally.  Change this?  (extensions to manage it or use global 'use undo prevention')

FIXED EVERYTHING takes a minute.  Some things maybe shouldn't?  Getting inventory, looking at the watch, at least.

FIXED (via global error msg)  - 'Use' verb is totally borked for everything. :-(

FIXED KleinBlaster problem - the Memory chip doesn't need to be programmed to make a KleinBlaster. :-(  Maybe have programming the chip'swap it' for a different chip type? (no, just have programming write the correct item-id)


Puzzle idea - have to mod nametag on torn jacket to get onto platform?


GREEN RESIDENTIAL:

FIXED.  -No way of knowing possible directions to travel.  (Use Exit Lister by Gavin Lambert extension? (TRIED) Or rewrite descriptions? Some things, like security gate outside apartment, will be 'left out of' Exit Lister when maybe you don't want that to happen)


MAYBE FIXED: [MICROWAVE] Microwave is confusing - can't use control, have to know the magic command 'microwave'.  Can't activate it either since it's a device.  Is it worth changing this whole thing to a device with a timed activation?  The panel is hard, too - looking at 'warning sticker' looks at the sticker on the cryopack, not the panel.  Trying to 'press button' turns on the soldering iron via button, not the microwave.  REENGINEER.  Add'l - maybe have to unplug oven to hack it? Possible, not necessary.  ALSO:  'open panel with tool' doesn't work, but 'open panel' does if holding the tool. Ugh.  'open panel with knife' gives 'can't unlock' message.  Also:  'component slot' doesn't work, just 'panel' does, but it's described as 'component slot.'  

[LAPTOP] Clock says interacting with laptop is 'clunky', maybe polish descriptions?  Maybe change commands?

FIXED? Car key.  You can't 'open' it with or without the knife.  'Open' tries to unlock.  Ugh.  You can only 'cut' it.  Maybe change description to describe it as a rubberized, sealed unit? Discouraging 'open' and etc?

FIXED - Security gate outside apt - make it an object(door)?, so player can try to unlock and open it, etc?

- Coffee - going into thermos as object, not liquid.  Should be in a cup, pourable into thermos, and it should short out any chip in the thermos. OR: should be eliminated?

FIXED - Drug den - need more clues that it's a place player should go.  Maybe hear/see activity from behind the fence?  Also:  "REPORT THINGS" posters around game as a hint?

FIXED - Fence should be a scenery/backdrop object, not a description ghost.

FIXED - You can't examine the dog in front of the other house because it doesn't exist. :-P

- MORE INFO ABOUT MITSUI-KLEIN BOTTLES NEEDED IN HOME

FIXED - FRY MEMORY AND BROADCAST USED IN HACKING OVEN? DONE.


TRANSIT:

FIXED -'enter capsule' doesn't work!  Doh.

CUTTING ACTIVITY

-uncuttable things that aren't containers (phone, pager, etc)
-uncuttable things that ARE containers (oven box, thermos, slots, etc)
-cuttable things that ARE containers to open them (tags, key)
-cuttable things that ARE containers to NOT open them (tags)
-cuttable things that AREN'T containers (fence, camera chain)



Possible code:

Understand "cut [something] with [something] as sutting it with.

Instead of cutting something:
	if a blade (called the edge) is held by the player:
		try cutting the noun with the edge;
	otherwise say "You don't seem to have anything to cut with."

Cutting it with is an action applying to two things.

Check cutting it with:
	if the noun is a person, say "That would be a wonderful way to get arrested." instead;
	if the second noun is not a blade, say "[The second noun] doesn't have a blade." instead.

Carry out cutting it with:
	<<do something>>

Carry out cutting a container with something:
	now the noun is open;
	now the noun is unopenable.

Carry out cutting something which is a part of something with something:
	say "You free [the noun] with a quick cut.";
	move the noun to the player.


Report cutting it with:
	if the noun is open and the noun contains something,
		say "Visible within [is-are a list of things in the noun]."

After printing the name of a closed unopenable container:
	omit contents in listing.






-----NEW REWRITE DISCUSSION----
custo:
the original story is much tighter and deals with motive via exposition

Ghetvark:
perhaps you should include a scene wherein the player is witness to the injustice of the surveillance on the MC

Ghetvark:
make it personal

custo:
SO

custo:
er, so

custo:
I tweaked the laptop screen and put a pamphlet in the mailbox

custo:
that talk about the player being under imminent risk

custo:
I don't think making the player philosophically hate surveillance is going to work

custo:
it's not buyable

custo:
but

Ghetvark:
you're right, i was trying to suggest "have the player get beat up because of a false positive" or something

custo:
I went with "last night you hacked the DHS, and they got your mitklein"

custo:
"So now if you want to move around at all, you have to deal with that, and longer term you won't be able to exist without one unless they have bigger problems."

custo:
I'm sort of torn between whether to emphasize the practical motivations or the philosophical ones.

Ghetvark:
the philosophical ones can come off preachy, best to be practical i think

custo:
yeah

custo:
I played with the idea of giving you a personal nemesis

custo:
a dhs agent who is attending the convention

custo:
which makes attacking the convention with klein bombs more obviously rational

custo:
but thats a pretty big change

Clockefeller left the chat room. (Quit: Leaving.)

Ghetvark|2:
the big bad needs to stay largely faceless, yeah

Ghetvark|2:
it's a cyberpunk story man, introduce folks and kill 'em off because corps don't give fuck bout humans

Ghetvark|2:
the bit about not being able to live comfortably without the mitklein is good but it's a long-term motivation, you know?

Ghetvark|2:
one of the best pieces of advice i ever got about writing adventures for D&D is to start them off with a bang, literally if possible and with a facepunch if not

You have returned from away.

custo:
well

You have returned from away.

custo:
remember

custo:
the first area puzzle is that you can't get out of the start area without dealing with your own mitklein

custo:
maybe I should have an expository lump when the player succeeds at that

Ghetvark:
what's the motivation to get out of the start area in the first place?

custo:
where it says something like "Hey, that worked!  Now if only there was a way to do it to Homeland Security…wouldn't that be cool..."

custo:
oh

custo:
heh

custo:
I assumed the fact that it was clear there was a puzzle to prevent you getting out.

custo:
I see.

custo:
i couldn't come up with more motivation that didn't involve timers

custo:
and i wasn't willing to go there.

Ghetvark:
you don't necessarily have to put a hard time limit on it

Ghetvark:
maybe the PC has a mysterious meeting he needs to make, as per a message left on his laptop

custo:
huh

custo:
and that person could give you the Plan

Ghetvark:
more clues about where to find a memory stick would be good too, it seemed weird that he didn't just have a spare lying around on his workbench

custo:
wouldn't even have to be a person

custo:
could be a ded drop.

custo:
yeah

Ghetvark:
yeah!

Ghetvark:
say the dead drop runs a high chance of being stumbled on because it got placed in a hurry last night

Clockefeller joined the chat room.

custo:
YOu get a message telling you that

custo:
that makes sense...

Ghetvark:
or it was /supposed/ to be a face to face but the other guy had to bail last minute and left a clue or two to the drop

custo:
so

custo:
instead of you finding the klein blaster through random hacking

custo:
maybe it was your *assignment*

custo:
you're a member of the underground

custo:
and they tell you 'well you did it but you're on the radar now so here's what you gotta do'

custo:
yeah see

custo:
that's the thing

custo:
the story was all about it being a lone maniac with a philosophical grudge

custo:
I gotta let that go.

Ghetvark:
don't let them spell it out to the last letter, just include a message like "get your mitklein wiped ASAP"

Clockefeller:
Hm could you maybe make the game a *sequel* to the story?

custo:
nah

custo:
the finale basically is the story

Ghetvark:
or just a side story, doesn't have to be the same MC

custo:
heh

custo:
the game finale

custo:
is rappelling down the reserve bank atrium tossing ID bombs

Clockefeller left the chat room. (Quit: Leaving.)

Ghetvark:
i like the underground assignment idea, make it his first assignment as part of the cell so the player has an excuse to fuck things up

custo:
ha

custo:
I could have the message come in on the cell phone with a 'self-destruct' that destroys the phone

custo:
"We found out they're after you and so this message will wipe your cell so it stops giving out your location"

Clockefeller joined the chat room.

Ghetvark:
THE OLE EXPLODING PHONE TRICK

custo:
hm

custo:
maybe this all would make more sense if you weren't in your own home

custo:
like

custo:
you were on the run with the contents of your backpack

custo:
and the house is one you break into to use the microwave

Ghetvark:
another excuse for the player to wander around and break into things

custo:
yeah!

custo:
wow

custo:
major rewrite lol

Ghetvark:
also that house with the tarp is super suspicious

custo:
oh

custo:
you can get into there

Clockefeller:
Mang I would advise against this course of action for that very reason.

custo:
and have to

Clockefeller:
But also:

custo:
you just can't get into there without a tool you have to escape the start area to get

Ghetvark:
(that is my fault then)

Clockefeller:
It needn't be a huge rewrite if the game opens with you having bust in.

custo:
yeah

Ghetvark:
aw yeah, then you can introduce the player to the multitool and whatnot

custo:
Id' have to get rid of all the eyescanners around the house

custo:
I could have the opening scene be one where the player has x time to get into a house before curfew

custo:
oooh

custo:
I like that

custo:
it emphasizes the whole 'get off the street' thing

custo:
so the opening puzzle then is 'GET OFF THE STREET'

custo:
jesus you know your cat is fat when him sitting in the middle of the sofa basically makes it unusable

Clockefeller:
:-D

You have returned from away.

custo:
CLock:  I understand your preference and you're probably right

You have returned from away.

custo:
but I was unhappy with the game flow

custo:
and this would seem to fix nearly all of it

custo:
I just needed to be run up against it hard enough to give up congruence with the fiction piece.

Clockefeller:
Righto. It's probably the good decision.

custo:
Besides, that plot will be more worthy of Zeph's awesome upcoming art.

Clockefeller:
If it were me I would be extremely unwilling to part with the congruence and I suspect that has colored my suggestions, too.

custo:
The advantage here

custo:
is that I have a basically full and functioning game

custo:
so this isn't like a midcourse change

custo:
where I end up breaking design which isn't finished.

Clockefeller:
Thatis certainly true.

custo:
unfortunately haha it means I'm going to have to implement a working cell phone among other issues.

Ghetvark:
there's at least one extension for telephones

custo:
nice

custo:
I can get away with it because if the protagonist is an underground operative they won't have people they call anyway

custo:
i.e. someone already paranoid and on the run

custo:
this is good

custo:
that is a *role*, which is easier to build in imagination

custo:
the current player is just 'some guy who lives in this apartment' so the lack of character development is very jarring

custo:
"who are your friends?  What's your job?  Where do you hang out?" all that is sort of a problem

custo:
whereas this reduces the protagonist to a situationist

custo:
THANKS GUYZ

•
Clockefeller
 
THUMB UP

•
OldMiner
 
OTHER THUMB UP

custo:
heh gonna have to implement actual day/night stuff too I guess

Clockefeller:
How come?

Clockefeller:
Can't you just do a scene for the first puzzle with a time limit, and handwave the rest wiht streetlights?

custo:
`well

custo:
if I want to get them off the street due to a curfew

custo:
the curfew needs to be consistent

custo:
also

custo:
it doesn't really make sense that the Homeland Security convention (i.e. the target) is in the spacescraper 24/7

custo:
it's cool, though, it lets me geek out adding atmosphere

custo:
almost all the important locations are 24/7

custo:
police station, hospital, bar, ATM...

custo:
the two stores are automated so it's OK

custo:
the only real weird one will be the clothing shop

Clockefeller:
Hm right so, as long as it doesn't add up to another stone to an increasing burden.

custo:
nah

Clockefeller:
You can see that I am cutting corners to get this show on the road :-D
