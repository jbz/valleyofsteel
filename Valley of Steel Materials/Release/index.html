<div class="about"><span><p>In a pervasive surveillance society, you'll dare to strike a blow for anonymity - but to stay free, you will need to take down the watchers. The creep of surveillance and control has continued unabated. Every citizen is required to have a chip implant which can definitively identify them to anyone with a scanner. You've spent years as a privacy hacker, and last night, after what might have been a few drinks too many, you may have achieved the grail. You are in possession of a cryptographic attack against the Mitsui-Klein Encapsulation that every citizen carries in their skull, which (if it works) will render the chip inoperative. The drink may have made you reckless, though. Your own MitKlein signature was captured during the attack. Although you did your best to wipe all records of your MitKlein signature from all the databases you could find, if you let your chip be scanned by any system it is likely that Homeland Security will be after you immediately. Short term, you'll have to figure out how to move around undetected - long term, you will have to bring the fight to Homeland Security itself.</p></span></div>
