# What is it?

Valley of Steel is an interactive fiction (intfic) game.  It was written in 
Inform 7.  I wrote it because as a kid I really really enjoyed the Infocom
games, and I'd written a <a href="http://everything2.com/user/The+Custodian/writeups/Meek+and+obedient+you+follow+the+leader+down+well+trodden+corridors+into+the+valley+of+steel">short story</a> that I thought might make a fun setting for
such a game.  I basically used this project to force myself to learn some
Inform, and to get myself 'coding' again.  I work in technology, and the
magic wore off a while back - I figured if I did something for myself, it'd
be more fun.  I was right.

# Can I play it?

Sure!  The link at the top of the page is a link to the release page, where you
can either download it free of charge or play in a browser. This repo is mostly
for me, as it consists of the Inform working directory.  If you want the 
playable game, I strongly encourage you to go to the link at the top of the
README, which is the official Inform 'release page.' 

# Can I use the code?

Yes.  This code is available under the MIT License.  The only exception is the
contents of the Valley of Steel Materials/ subdirectory - those are 
ALL RIGHTS RESERVED (cover art, any original prose).

Note that the 'code' that you care about is in one text file, available 
<a href="https://github.com/jbz/valleyofsteel/tree/master/Valley%20of%20Steel.inform/Source">here</a>
in the source tree.
